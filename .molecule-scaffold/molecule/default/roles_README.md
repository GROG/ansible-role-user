# Why is the roles folder here?
Under what is probably considered "normal" circumstances, if the rolename does not match the working copy folder name, then converge will fail. This is because ansible will look in varios locations for a folder named the same as the rolename, and will fail, if it does not find it. ```molecule/scenario_name/roles``` is one such location which is reasonably accessible and within the grasp of ```mkansiblerole``` so this is where there is a symlink to the working copy named the same as the role. The end result being that the role you are developing, is applied when ```converge.yml``` is run and the role referenced there within. Without this symlink, ansible will tell you it cannot apply the role, because it cannot find it. There are a number of other options to work around this problem, including overriding the location where git clones code to the name of the role, or manually symlinking your working copy to one of the places ansible looks for roles.
